## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

The Meal Plan app is meant to introduce the usage of Django Unicorn from start to finish. It will be accompanied by a tutorial that walks through setting up a Django application and incorporating Django Unicorn.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

More information will be in the forthcoming tutorial. For the time being, you should be able to follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed on your system.

You can install Python from [Python.org](https://www.python.org)

### Installing

1. Clone the project to your local machine. If you are unsure how to do that, refer to documentation on Github.
2. Create a virtual environment (`python -m venv .venv`) and activate it (on Linux/Mac it is `source .venv/bin/activate`)
3. Install Django and Django Unicorn (`python -m pip install Django django-unicorn`)
4. Migrate the database (`python manage.py migrate`)


## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
